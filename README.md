When searching for the latest version of laravel there was no version compatible with Windows 8.1(my pc)
So I had to setup a jsonserver to work with my libros-app

You don't have to use any dependencies. Just download the zip file from my repository on github (12Mb) and extract the files to your desktop folder


Once the files has been extracted, open the folder jsonserver-master with your code editor

then, run this line to run the server:

>npm run json:server
