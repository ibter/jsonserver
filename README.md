When searching for the latest version of laravel there was no version compatible with Windows 8.1(my pc)
So I had to setup a jsonserver to work with my libros-app

Download the zip file from my repository on github and extract the files to your desktop folder


Once the files has been extracted, open the folder jsonserver-master with your code editor

then, run this line to run the server:

>npm run json:server
