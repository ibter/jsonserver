When searching for the latest version of laravel there was no version compatible with Windows 8.1(my pc)

So I had to setup a jsonserver to work with my libros-app. I used ReactJs, NPM, NODE.






Download the zip file from my repository on github and extract the files to your desktop folder

Once the files has been extracted, open the folder jsonserver-master with your code editor

then, run this line to run the server:

>npm run json:server

Server should be running on localhost:3000 

Now open libros-app-master folder on your code editor

run this lines:

>npm install react-scripts

This should install node_modules

Now run this:

>npm start

when promted to other port hit enter or the Y-KEY for 'yes'

This should open libros-app on localhost:3001
